# SDETtest-Backend
Nasa Project

## Show your work
1.  Create a Public repository
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## Challenge
Create pilot Java test framework for testing NASA's open API (https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#getting-started). The purpose of the test is to check images which were made by Curiosity (https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images). Test scenario:

Get first 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on 1000 sol.
Get the same 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on earth date that is equals 1000 Mars sol.
Compare downloaded images and metadata from API. Test fails in case of any difference.
As a plus: Using NASAâ€™s API determine how many pictures were made by each camera (by Curiosity on 1000 sol.). If any camera made 10 times more images than any other - test fails.

Please use standard technologies, tools and frameworks which you are usually use in test frameworks creation.

## Instructions
You will need to fork the repository and build the solution in your private Github. Once you are finished, please send a Zip file with the solution.

Please do not upload solution to your public Github repository, only send a Zip with the solution.

Implementation deadline is 1 week. Please let us know the time that you spent to achieve the task.

## Technologies
You can use any language of your choice, preferably JAVA or JS but is not restrictive, avoid the usage of "canned tools" such as Selenium IDE (not to be mistaken with Selenium WebDriver, you can use Selenium WebDriver), QTP, etc.

## Time Spent
We suggest not to spend more than 5 hours total, which can be done over the course of 2 days.  Please make commits as often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one commit.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.
 
What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve everything.
